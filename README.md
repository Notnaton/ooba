Ensure you have installed Open-interpreter first.
<br>

I have made a few (experimental) fixes Windows:
- After installing Open-interpreter `pip install open-interpreter`
- Run `pip install git+https://github.com/Notnaton/ooba.git@windows --force-reinstall`. 

This will download and install some patches I have made for Ooba.
You can check the code here: https://github.com/Notnaton/ooba/tree/windows
This is experimental and will be updated at random times. 
Should you have a problem please run: `interpreter --local --debug` and make an issue here: https://github.com/Notnaton/ooba/issues

You can remove changes by running `pip install ooba --force-reinstall`

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Notnaton/ooba.git@windows
```
